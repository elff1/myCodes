The Summer Research Program is a 10-week intensive research training and recruitment
program. Students will conduct research on a full-time basis under the guidance of a UCLA
faculty research mentor. Each student will be enrolled in 8 units of UCLA courses and participate
in required CSST activities including career development seminars, networking activities, and final
presentations. Through the Summer Program, students will have the opportunity to highlight their
talents and be recommended for recruitment to UCLA PhD Programs.
