--For Built our compiler for C- that suitable for your machine, Make sure that your machine has installed gcc, flex and yacc

--Firstly, run the shell build.sh to compile our source codes and generate a compiler (named CMinusCompiler) that can compile a C- program into nasm code.

--secondly, run the shell make.sh with two argument $1 and $2.
It will compiler the C- program $1 into a exetable file $2.
If you obmit the seconde argument, the output file will be named "a.out" by default.

notice: 
--you can use the function input() to get an input and output(int para) to output a variable para in your C- program, it is define by the system.
--If you want to see the nasm code for your codes, you can delete the last line in the shell make.sh before runing it.
